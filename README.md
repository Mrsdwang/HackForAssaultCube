# HackForAssaultCube

A rough AssaultCube v1.3.0.2 FPS game hack.

you can download the game from:https://github.com/assaultcube/AC


After compiling the project，you will get a DLL file.

then Use DLL injection to inject this DLL to the game. 

you can use my [DLL injection tool](https://github.com/Mrsdwang/LittleDllInjectionTool).

after injection, you can use the keyboard arrow keys to turn the functions on or off (up and down to select, left and right to turn on or turn off).

the aimbot is enabled if you hold down the left mouse button while there are enemies in your view，but it's not always accurate.

the internal esp and aimbot use the same calculation method，so the internal esp doesn't always display correctly

the triggerbot is only suitable to rifles and submachine guns.
